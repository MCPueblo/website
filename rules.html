                                <li>Maturity is important on MCPueblo. We do not tolerate heated arguments (especially
                                    around politics), hate speech, rudeness, or excessive swearing (some swearing is
                                    fine).

                    <p>The first three general rules apply in Discord, but below are the Discord-specific rules:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Chat in the correct channels</strong> - Don't send screenshots in #general, or talk
                            about woodworking in #other-games.</li>
                        <li><strong>Utilize spoiler tags when appropriate </strong> - <span
                                style="background-color: #646464; color: #646464;">Batman dies in Harry Potter because
                                of Obama.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>No inappropriate status</strong> - If you are spotted with one, you will be
                            contacted immediately. Not removing it quickly or breaking this rule twice will be punished.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Keep your nickname as your Minecraft username</strong> - It must match exactly the
                            same. The whitelist bot will set one for you, and the Discord link feature will always keep
                            it in sync.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ping staff only when needed</strong> - You may only ping staff for when a member is
                            breaking rules or if you need an important question answered.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="box" id="punishment">
                <div>
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Punishment & Appeal</h2>
                    <p>We utilize the following forms of punishment when needed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Warnings</li>
                        <li>Mute</li>
                        <li>Kick</li>
                        <li>Temporary ban</li>
                        <li>Permanent ban</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each rule has their own punishment type depending on the number of offenses, but they may change
                        depending on the severity of the rule violation. If you receive 2 warnings, you will be banned
                        for a day, and the 3rd warning will be an permanent ban. All bans/mutes/warnings/kicks can be
                        found publicly at <a href="https://bans.mcpueblo.net">bans.mcpueblo.net</a></p>
                    <p>If you wish to appeal after a permanent ban, at least 1 month of time after the ban must have
                        passed. Once that time has passed, you may fill the appeal form <a
                            href="https://forms.gle/H3xL9gxnR55kjFXK9">located here</a>, but remember you are not
                        guaranteed to be unbanned. You can try once every 3 month if that appeal was rejected or
                        ignored.</p>
